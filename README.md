# PathDetector
The aim of this project was assigning a path to an Ultrasonic Sensor Controlled Robot, detecting flaws in the program and designing a PID controller in order to optimaize the its function. <br>
Paths we chose for the Robot are as follow: <br>
1. According to the arrows inside the image
2. A-B-D-F-G-C-D-E-G-H-I-C-B-C-D-A

* We used trigonometric relations to find the size of angles and lines.
* Angels (Radian), Lines (Meter)
* Change this measurments in the "Robot Movement" part of the code. 
* The other parts are related to the robot's controller system and transfer functions. 
* Use positive angle for TURNING RIGHT and negative angle for TURNING LEFT.
* In the program, some numbers are seen as coefficients, these numbers are  PID coefficients that were calculated during repeated tests as well as manual calculations which improve the robot's performance. 
* the MATLAB file is a simulator. Use Arduino file to programm the robot.
